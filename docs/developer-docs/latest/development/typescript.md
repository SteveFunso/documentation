# TypeScript development

::: callout ðŸš§  TypeScript documentation
This section is still a work in progress and will continue to be updated and improved. Migrating existing Strapi applications written in JavaScript is not currently recommended. In the meantime, feel free to ask for help on the [forum](https://forum.strapi.io/) or on the community [Discord](https://discord.strapi.io).
:::

TypeScript adds an additional type system layer above JavaScript, which means that existing JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. Strapi supports TypeScript in new projects on v4.2.0 and above. TypeScript-enabled projects allow developing plugins with TypeScript as well as using TypeScript typings.

::: strapi Getting started with TypeScript
To start developing in TypeScript, use the [CLI documentation](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.md) to create a new TypeScript project. Additionally, the [project structure](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/file-structure.md) and [TypeScript configuration](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/optional/typescript.md) sections have TypeScript-specific resources for understanding and configuring an application.
:::

## Start developing in TypeScript

Starting the development environment for a TypeScript-enabled project requires building the admin panel prior to starting the server. In development mode, the application source code is compiled to the `./dist/build` directory and recompiled with each change in the Content-type Builder. To start the application, run the following commands in the root directory:

<code-group>

<code-block title="NPM">

```sh
npm run build
npm run develop
```

</code-block>

 <code-block title="YARN">

```sh
yarn build
yarn develop
```

</code-block>

</code-group>

## Use TypeScript typings

Strapi provides typings on the `Strapi` class to improve the TypeScript developing experience. These typings come with an autocomplete feature that automatically offers suggestions while developing.

To experience TypeScript-based autocomplete while developing Strapi applications, you could try the following:

1. From your code editor, open the `./src/index.ts` file.
2. In the `register` method, declare the `strapi` argument as of type `Strapi`:

    ```js
    // path: ./src/index.ts

    import '@strapi/strapi';

    export default {
      register( { strapi }: { strapi: Strapi }) {
        // ...
      },
    };
    ```

2. Within the body of the `register` method, start typing `strapi.` and use keyboard arrows to browse the available properties.
3. Choose `runLifecyclesfunction` from the list.
4. When the `strapi.runLifecyclesFunctions` method is added, a list of available lifecycle types (i.e. `register`, `bootstrap` and `destroy`) are returned by the code editor. Use keyboard arrows to choose one of the lifecycles and the code will autocomplete.

## Develop a plugin using TypeScript

New plugins can be generated following the [plugins development documentation](/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins-development.md). There are 2 important distinctions for TypeScript applications:

- After creating the plugin, run `yarn install` or `npm run install` in the plugin directory `src/admin/plugins/[my-plugin-name]` to install the dependencies for the plugin.
- Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` in the plugin directory `src/admin/plugins/[my-plugin-name]` to build the admin panel including the plugin.

::: note
It is not necessary to repeat the `yarn install` or `npm run install` command after the initial installation. The `yarn build` or `npm run build` command is necessary to implement any plugin development that affects the admin panel.
:::

## Start Strapi programmatically

Starting Strapi programmatically in a TypeScript project requires additional configurations to load everything correctly. The primary difference for TypeScript programmatic use is that the codebase and compiled code are stored in separate directories, whereas the same directory is used to read and write in native JavaScript.

### Understand programmatic use

When instantiating Strapi programmatically using the default export of `@strapi/strapi`, different parameters such as the directories containing the codebase and the compiled codebase can be passed. The codebase is located at the root of the project in the directory name chosen during installation, while the compiled codebase is in the subdirectory `dist` ([see project structure](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/file-structure.md)). Compared to a native JavaScript application, the primary differences are:

- When using the Content-type Builder to create, update, delete content types (or any other service that creates files), files are written to the root directory.
- Content types are read from the `dist` folder.
- In development mode the root directory is watched and when a change is detected in the output is be written to the `dist` directory.

::: note
The public folder is considered static and thus ignores the  `app` and `dist` directories.
:::

When starting Strapi programmatically by running `strapi()`, you can pass 2 optional parameters, `appDir` and `distDir`, to set the path of the root directory and the compiled codebase directory respectively. This can lead to the following combinations:

| `appDir` parameter value | `distDir` parameter value | Actual `app` directory    | Actual `dist` directory   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------    | -----------------------   |
| -                        | -                         | current working directory | current working directory | 
| `./app`                  | -                         | `./app`                    | `./app`                    | 
| -                        | `./dist`                  | current working directory | `./dist`                  | 
| `./app`                  | `./dist`                  | `./app`                   | `./dist` | 



For example, if the compiled code is stored in a separate directory (eg: when using TypeScript)  Strapi should be instantiated with a specific `distDir` value which matches the path of your build directory.

::: caution
Do not set `appDir` to `build` or `dist` directory as it could cause issues when the app tries to write some files.
:::

::: details Examples of how Strapi resolves directories based on passed parameters:

<!--Note: I don't really understand this section.-->
The default values for the `app` and `dist` directories are transformed and assigned using one of the following options:

```js
const resolveWorkingDirectories = opts => {
  const cwd = process.cwd(); // Neither the appDir or distDir are passed. Both the appDir and distDir are set to process.cwd().

  const appDir = opts.appDir ? path.resolve(cwd, opts.appDir) : cwd; // Only appDir is defined distDir matches appDir.

  const distDir = opts.distDir ? path.resolve(cwd, opts.distDir) : appDir; // Only distDir is defined, appDir is set to process.cwd().

  return { appDir, distDir };
}

```
Start Strapi for JavaScript applications:

```js
const strapi = require('@strapi/strapi');

strapi();
// appDir => process.cwd() | distDir => process.cwd()

```

Start Strapi using a custom `dist` directory:

```js
const strapi = require('@strapi/strapi');

strapi({ distDir: './dist' });
// appDir => process.cwd() | distDir => './dist'
```

Start Strapi using custom `app` and `dist` directories:

```js

const strapi = require('@strapi/strapi');

strapi({ appDir: './app', distDir: './dist' });
// appDir => './app' | distDir => './dist'

```

Start Strapi using a custom `app` directory:

```js

const strapi = require('@strapi/strapi');

strapi({ appDir: './app' });
// appDir => './app' | distDir => './app'

```

:::

### Use both JavaScript and TypeScript codebases when starting Strapi programmatically

Adding the package `@strapi/typescript-utils` allows for both JavaScript and TypeScript codebases to be used programatically. A common use is for creating command line interface tools or developing a plugin. The following are examples of how to incorporate both code bases:

```js

const strapi = require('@strapi/strapi');

const appContext = await strapi.compile();
// Start the app by providing the app and dist directories:
const app = await strapi(appContext).load();

// NOTE TO SELF: all of the deleted code when to the compiled method ->checking for JS and/or TS if TS, resolve from config the distDir value `outDir` fetched from tsconfig and set distDir to outDir value. 

```
